## Test 7.3: Cache Effectiveness

### Objective
Verify that caching significantly improves translation performance.

### Test Code
```typescript
test('Cached translation is faster', async () => {
  const text = 'Hello world';
  
  // First call (uncached)
  const start1 = performance.now();
  await translationService.translate({
    text,
    sourceLang: 'en',
    targetLang: 'hi',
  });
  const duration1 = performance.now() - start1;
  
  // Second call (cached)
  const start2 = performance.now();
  await translationService.translate({
    text,
    sourceLang: 'en',
    targetLang: 'hi',
  });
  const duration2 = performance.now() - start2;
  
  expect(duration2).toBeLessThan(duration1 * 0.1); // 90% faster
});
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ First call: ~2500ms (cache miss)
- ✅ Second call: ~150ms (cache hit)
- ✅ Speedup factor: ~16x
- ✅ Cache hit rate: > 30%

### Running Test 7.3
```bash
pnpm exec jest tests/performance/cache-effectiveness.test.ts --testNamePattern="Cached translation is faster"

pnpm exec jest tests/integration/end-to-end.test.ts --verbose

# Run specific flow
pnpm exec jest tests/integration/end-to-end.test.ts --testNamePattern="Chat with Translation"

# Check dependencies
npm ls
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Profile performance
node --prof tests/integration/end-to-end.test.ts
node --prof-process isolate-*.log > profile.txt

# Check system resources
top -b -n 1 | head -20
free -h
